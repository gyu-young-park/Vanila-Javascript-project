This repo is made to practice vanilla javascript implementation. 

## Are you sure, you are good at JS??

My Answer is **No**, i'm not good at JS. Although I know well about React, Redux, Nextjs and Nestjs, Knowing some frameworks is not important. because that is not my ability, so i realized i have to study more js and vanilla javascript.
